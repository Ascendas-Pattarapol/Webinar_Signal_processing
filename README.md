# 📊 3rd Webinar Series: Signal Processing (07-Aug-2025)

## 🧠 Overview
This session introduces practical applications of signal processing using MATLAB, guiding participants from raw data import to exporting refined audio signals. We will explore real-world use cases, apply preprocessing techniques, design custom filters, and demonstrate how to generate reusable functions.

## 📝 Agenda

### 0. Why Do We Need Signal Processing?
- Real-world Use Cases
- Topics Covered in Today’s Webinar

### 1. Import Data
- Load audio/signal data into MATLAB workspace

### 2. Design Custom Filter
- Use **Design Filter Task** in MATLAB Live Editor
- Visualize and tune filter parameters interactively

### 3. Signal Analyzer App
- **Select ROI** (Region of Interest)
- **Preprocessing** (e.g., denoising, detrending)
- **Time-Frequency Analysis** (spectrogram, spectrum)
- **Export/Generate Function** for reusable workflows

### 4. Generate Function
- Automatically generate MATLAB functions from app workflows

### 5. Reuse & Export
- Apply the function to new data
- Export the processed signal to a new audio file
